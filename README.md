#  E-Commerce Data Analytics Project (Python + SQL)
This project focuses on analyzing real-world e-commerce data using Python and SQL. The goal is to extract valuable business insights from customer orders, payments, products, and sellers data.

##  Objective
To analyze e-commerce data and uncover trends in customer behavior, purchase patterns, sales performance, and repeat order behavior using advanced SQL and Python tools.

##  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- MySQL (via MySQL Workbench)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL (Joins, CTEs, Aggregations, Window Functions)

##  Key Highlights
- Connected SQL database to Python using `mysql.connector`
- Performed data cleaning, transformation, and visual analysis
- Solved real-world business questions across customer behavior, sales trends, and performance tracking
- Applied SQL logic like `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `CTEs`, `DATE_ADD()` and more
- Visualized insights using bar charts, line graphs, and cumulative trends
